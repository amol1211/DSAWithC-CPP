/*Explanation:
BFS Approach:

BFS ensures that we find the shortest path (minimum moves) to reach the target configuration.
Each level of the BFS represents one move.
State Representation:

The puzzle board is converted into a single string to simplify state transitions and comparisons.
The string allows direct manipulation of positions, such as finding the index of '0' and performing swaps.
Swap Map (mp):

The map defines the valid swaps for each index, ensuring only legal moves are attempted.
Visited Set:

Keeps track of visited configurations to avoid revisiting states and entering infinite loops.
Early Exit:

If the target configuration is reached, return the number of moves immediately.
Key Calculation:
For a 
2
√ó
3
2√ó3 board:

The board has 6 tiles, including a "0" (empty space).
There are 6!.
6! (factorial of 6) = 720 unique permutations of the tiles.

Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: In the worst-case scenario, the BFS must explore all possible permutations of the board, which is 6!.

At each state, we check up to 4 possible swaps (since "0" can move up, down, left, or right depending on its position).
However, since the number of swaps per state is constant, the dominating factor remains 6!

Thus, time complexity = 
ùëÇ(6!) or O(720).
Space Complexity: The BFS queue and the visited set can each hold up to 6! states in the worst case.
Each state is a string of length 6, so the space required for the queue and visited set is proportional to 
6!√ó6, but the constant factor (string length) is typically omitted in asymptotic complexity.

Thus, space complexity = 
O(6!) or O(720).
